### GoldOptimizer: Boosting Recovery for Zyfra

#### Overview
This project delves into the gold recovery process data for Zyfra, a company developing efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The primary aim is to predict the amount of gold recovered from ore and optimize production processes. By analyzing data on extraction and purification, the project will build and train a machine learning model to identify unprofitable parameters and enhance overall efficiency. The ultimate goal is to maximize gold recovery and streamline operations, ensuring Zyfra's production processes are as effective as possible.

#### Questions/Commands
