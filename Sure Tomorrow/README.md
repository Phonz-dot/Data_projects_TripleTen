### Sure Tomorrow: Enhancing Insurance Solutions with Machine Learning

#### Overview
This project explores the potential of machine learning to solve key challenges for the Sure Tomorrow insurance company. The primary aim is to evaluate how machine learning can enhance customer segmentation, predict insurance benefits, and ensure data privacy. By analyzing customer data and developing predictive models, the project seeks to improve marketing efforts, operational efficiency, and data protection. Tasks include identifying similar customers for targeted marketing, predicting the likelihood and number of insurance benefits a new customer may receive, and implementing data masking techniques to secure personal information without compromising model accuracy. Through comprehensive data analysis and model training, the project aims to optimize processes and provide valuable insights for the Sure Tomorrow insurance company.

#### Questions/Commands
- **What does this project do?**
- Filters the dataset to include only relevant customer data for insurance evaluation.
  - Groups customers based on similar attributes to assist in targeted marketing efforts.
  - Identifies and excludes outliers with unusual attributes that could skew model predictions.
  - Calculates and verifies the likelihood of a new customer receiving insurance benefits, comparing model predictions against a baseline untrained model for accuracy.
  - Develops a linear regression model to predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive.
  - Implements data masking techniques to protect personal information while maintaining model performance.

#### Prerequisites
- Access to the required dataset containing customer information and insurance details.
- Basic understanding of data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts and algorithms.
- Knowledge of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
- Experience with data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Understanding of linear regression models for predicting the number of insurance benefits.
- Awareness of data privacy and security principles, particularly data masking and obfuscation techniques.
- Skills in evaluating model performance using metrics like MAE and comparison against dummy models.

#### Functionality
- **Filtering**: Selects relevant customer data for analysis and machine learning model development.
- **Customer Grouping**: Identifies and clusters similar customers to assist in targeted marketing efforts.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detects and removes anomalous customer data points that could distort model predictions.
- **Benefit Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit.
- **Regression Analysis**: Employs a linear regression model to estimate the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive.
- **Data Masking**: Implements data obfuscation techniques to protect clients' personal information without degrading the performance of the predictive models.
