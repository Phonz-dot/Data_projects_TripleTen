### Sweet Lift Taxi: Predicting Taxi Orders Using Machine Learning

#### Overview
This project delves into the taxi order dataset collected by Sweet Lift Taxi company, focusing on predicting the number of taxi orders at airports for the next hour to attract more drivers during peak hours. The primary aim is to enhance driver availability by developing an accurate forecasting model through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning.
