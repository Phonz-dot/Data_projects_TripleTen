### Well Finder: Maximizing Profit Margins for OilyGiant 

#### Overview
This project delves into the geological exploration data for the OilyGiant mining company. The primary aim is to identify the most profitable location for a new oil well by analyzing the quality and volume of oil reserves across three regions. Utilizing linear regression and the Bootstrap technique, the project will predict the volume of reserves, calculate potential profits, and assess risks. The ultimate goal is to enhance decision-making and maximize profit margins for OilyGiant by choosing the region with the highest profitability.

#### Questions/Commands
- **What does this project do?**
- Filters the dataset to include only geological exploration data for three regions.
  - Groups features into relevant categories such as oil quality, volume of reserves, and well location for comprehensive analysis.
  - Identifies and excludes outliers by examining unusual data points that could skew results, ensuring robust analysis.
  - Calculates and verifies the predicted volume of reserves for new wells using linear regression, assessing the modelâ€™s accuracy with RMSE.
  - Evaluates potential profit and risks using the Bootstrap technique, providing a comprehensive analysis to select the region with the highest profit margin.
 
 #### Prerequisites
